<!-- ========================== -->
<!-- DOCTYPE Declaration: Specifies the HTML version. Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
HTML Document Structure:
<html>: Root element of the document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document (e.g., title, styles).
<body>: Contains the content of the page -->

<!-- ====================   -->
<!-- name="viewport"
Specifies that the <meta> tag applies to the viewport, which is the user's visible area of a web page. -->
<!-- 2. content="..."
This part contains the settings for the viewport. Let's analyze the parameters:

width=device-width:

Sets the width of the viewport to match the width of the device's screen.
For example:
On a desktop, the viewport width will match the screen width in pixels.
On a mobile phone, it adjusts to the smaller screen width.
initial-scale=1.0:

Sets the initial zoom level of the web page when it is first loaded.
A value of 1.0 means no zoom (default scale).
Purpose
This meta tag ensures that your web page:

Scales properly on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Provides a better user experience by adapting to different screen sizes.
Avoids issues like the text or layout being too small to read or interact with on mobile devices. -->
