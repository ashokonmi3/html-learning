<!-- CSS Selectors
In CSS, selectors are used to select HTML elements that we want to style. 
There are different types of selectors based on how we target elements in HTML. 
Below are the key types of CSS selectors.

1. Type Selector (Element Selector)
Definition: The type selector, also known as the element selector, targets all elements of a specific type.
Usage: If you want to apply styles to all elements of a particular type (like <p>, <h1>, or <div>), you use the type selector. -->
<!-- ===================== -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Type Selector Example</title>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>CSS Type Selector</h1>
  <p>This paragraph is selected using the type selector and will be blue.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph with the same styling applied.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- ===================== -->
<!-- 2. Universal Selector
Definition: The universal selector (*) targets all elements on the page. It is useful when you want to apply styles universally across all elements.
Usage: It can be used to reset styles or apply a common style to all elements. -->
<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Universal Selector Example</title>
  <style>
    * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>CSS Universal Selector</h1>
  <p>This paragraph has no margin or padding, as the universal selector applied these styles.</p>

</body>
</html> -->

<!-- Explanation: The universal selector (*) applies margin: 0; padding: 0; to all elements, removing the default margin and padding. -->

<!-- =================== -->
<!-- 3. ID Selector
Definition: The ID selector targets an element with a specific id attribute. It is unique on a page, meaning that no two elements should share the same id.
Usage: The ID selector is used when you need to target a specific element that has a unique id. -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>ID Selector Example</title>
  <style>
    #specialText {
      color: red;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>CSS ID Selector</h1>
  <p id="specialText">This paragraph is selected using the ID selector and will be red and bold.</p>
  <p>This paragraph is not affected by the ID selector.</p>

</body>
</html> -->

<!-- Explanation: The #specialText selector targets the element with the id="specialText", making the text red and bold. -->

<!-- ============================= -->

<!-- 4. Class Selector
Definition: The class selector targets all elements with a specific class. Unlike IDs, multiple elements can share the same class.
Usage: The class selector is useful for styling groups of elements in the same way.
Example: -->
<!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Class Selector Example</title>
  <style>
    .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>CSS Class Selector</h1>
  <p class="highlight">This paragraph is highlighted with a yellow background using the class selector.</p>
  <p class="highlight">This paragraph also has the same styling because it shares the same class.</p>
  <p>This paragraph does not have the "highlight" class, so it is not affected by the class selector.</p>

</body>
</html> -->

<!-- Explanation: The .highlight selector applies a yellow background and 18px font size to all elements with the highlight class. -->

<!-- ========================= -->
